# Scrape Hotel
In this project, I have to do the web scraping from three different accommodation booking websites, store the information in an efficient way, visualize them accordingly and make a user-friendly interaction so that a user can easily see the hotels along with the details based on their preference.

From the graphs we observed that Most of the hotels that we collected are 3- and 4-stars hotels and most of them have a good review score of 8. Additionally, the price ranges vary from mostly 50 USD to 200 USD but most of them are basically from !00-150 USD range. We also observed that as the stars goes higher also the price gees higher as well. Same thing we observed from the correlation is that there is a positive association between Review Score and Price.
